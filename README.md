### ERC20 Token Template

Following the popular OpenZeppelin ERC20 template, contracts/Token/basicCoin.sol implements ERC20 token ready for deployment on to mainnet. Template allows for easy customization and extensions. Current contract extensions are:

| extension                                             | Description                                                       |

1. Minting and burning tokens to specific address
2. Redistributing tokens to existing holders on transaction (gasless staking)
3. Redirecting transaction fees into liquidity pools (WIP)

I'm always open for new suggestions and extension to add.
