### DeFi: Merkle Airdrop

Merkle airdrops are the next iteration of airdrop contracts and are designed to be more gas-efficient and practical than original airdrop
implementations. The main different with Merkle airdrop is that token aidrops are claimed by users rather automatically sent to them. Hence
gas cost is paid by the users rather than the sponsoring company. The contract uses merkle tree structure and proofs to verify each user's
claim of the airdrop and ensures none are paid more than once.
