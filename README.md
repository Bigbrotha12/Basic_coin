# Basic_coin

Basic coin is a standard ERC20 template to be used for generating tokens with different functionalities. The basic contract can be extended with following functionality:
1. Minting and burning tokens to specific address
2. Redistributing tokens to existing holders on transaction (gasless staking)
3. Redirecting transaction fees into liquidity pools (WIP)

I'm always open for new suggestions and extension to add.
